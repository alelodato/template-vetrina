# Template per Siti Vetrina

## This template provides a minimal setup to get React/Vite.

The template has React/Vite installed and is structured as a React frontend project.
React Router Dom is installed and has a router.jsx file, containing all the paths for the template pages.
The Router is hosted in main.jsx.
App.jsx contains the basic structure of the template pages: Navbar at the top, Footer at the bottom, and the main the changed based on the page is accessed.
I added a standard contact page with a form powered by emailJS.
